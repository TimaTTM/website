Introduction

About the Project

TTM (Track Trade Manage) is an innovative platform that includes three key directions:

A gaming platform where users can play and earn TTM tokens.

A project verification and security analysis service to prevent fraud by scanning wallets and associated accounts.

An investment platform that will invest in promising projects using TTM tokens.

The project aims to create an ecosystem that connects entertainment, security, and investments, providing value and growth opportunities for participants.

Mission Statement

TTM's mission is to create a unique ecosystem that unites users and investors through gaming platforms, project verification services, and secure investments. We strive to become an essential part of the digital world, ensuring transparency and earning opportunities for users.

Problem and Solution

Problems TTM Addresses

Lack of trust in the gaming sector: Many games do not offer real earning opportunities or transparency and may involve fraudulent schemes.

Fraud in the crypto space: High risks in investing in projects with dishonest developers can lead to financial losses.

Lack of transparency in investments: The absence of proper tools for evaluating and verifying crypto projects before investing.

How TTM Solves These Problems

Gaming platform with tokens: Users can play and earn TTM tokens through competitive games, tournaments, and in-game purchases.

Project verification service: A platform utilizing automated bots and manual analysis to ensure project reliability and security.

Investments in promising projects: A system allowing users to invest in carefully selected and secure projects, minimizing risks.

Technology

Gaming Platform

The platform will be based on blockchain technology, ensuring decentralization and transparency in transactions. A game inspired by Clash Royale will allow users to earn TTM tokens through victories, tournaments, and in-game purchases.

Project Verification Service

The service employs machine learning and bots for automatic scanning and evaluating the security of projects. If an automated check is inconclusive, the project will undergo a manual review.

Investment Platform

The investment platform will include automated risk assessment algorithms and an interface for tracking investments, allowing users to monitor project performance.
